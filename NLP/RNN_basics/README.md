Here are few recurrent neural networks (RNN):

* Binary adder: Add two binary numbers, i.e. 0011110110 + 1011100110 => 1001101011
* Linear RNN: Counts # of 1's in a binary string, i.e. 011000010011 => 5   
* Random Walk Time Series: RNN learns random walk and predicts future position of the walker. 
        However, by closer inspection we realise it is overfitting.
