## Reinforcement Learning

I have finished learning Reinforcement Learning (RL) on Udacity, [Reinforcement Learning by Georgia Tech](https://www.udacity.com/course/reinforcement-learning--ud600).
That course provides solid theoretical foundation, but it does not have practical assignments. The best way to learn something is to practice.
I decided to practice different RL algorithms myself by solving various RL agents provided by GYM open source library
(https://gym.openai.com/).

The following algorithms have been implemented:

  * Random search (Mountain car)
  * Genetic algorithm (Mountain car)
  * Q-learning (Mountain car)
  * Value iteration (Frozen Lake)
  * Policy iteration (Frozen Lake)
  * Deep Reinforcement learning (Pong)
