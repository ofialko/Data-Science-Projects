## Reinforcement Learning

I have finished learning Reinforcement Learning on Udacity, [Reinforcement Learning by Georgia Tech](https://www.udacity.com/course/reinforcement-learning--ud600).
That course provides solid theoretical foundation, but it does not have practical
assignments. I decided to try different algorithms myself to solve one of the classic control agent, namely [Mountain Car](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#classic_control).

Here, I provide several solutions. The following algorithms were used:

  * Random search
  * Genetic algorithm
  * Q-learning
  * Deep Reinforcement learning
