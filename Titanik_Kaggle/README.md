## Titanic problem: learning from disaster

Here I present my solution to the Titanic problem posted on Kaggle. I used both Python and R.
Complete solution was produced with Python and it is given in two python notebook files.
[The first one](Titanic1.ipynb) scored ~0.77, while [the second one](Titanic2.ipynb) 
(more recent attempt) scored ~0.8. Summary is provided in [R markdown file](Titanic.md).
