* The reviews were preprocessed by removing stop words and spaces and converting words into lemmas
* Bi-gram model was applied to treat words like "New York" as a single token "New_York"
* Topic modeling, word vector modeling
* Deep Learning models (Bag of words, GRU) were applied to predict rankings
